this is the final version of a website I made for my WebDev class. As said during my presentation, 
why go to youtube to listen to music if you can create a website with all your favoutive songs to take you there. 
This is definitly a bit of a silly project and not really functional, but it did allow me to understand the functions of HTML and CSS and incorporate them
into something "functional".

So enjoy the silly little website I called Me-tube.
