                        <p>this is the final version of a website I made for my WebDev class.<br>
                           I thought why go to youtube to listen to music when I can create a website <br>
                           with all your favoutive songs to take you there.<br>
                           This is definitly a bit of a silly project and not really functional,<br>
                           but it did allow me to understand the functions of HTML and CSS and incorporate them<br>
                           into something "functional".<br>

                        <p>I started this project around august of 2024 as a part of my internship at my college<br>
                             where i did 300 hours of work.<br>
                            The main idea was to become more profitient in HTML, CSS, and even some JavaScript, <br>
                             while working on something that I had creative freedom over.<br>
                            It was neccecarry to esstablish a strong foundation before starting on a project for my university.<br>
                            This way I was able to learn the stuff i needed to know on a black canvas,<br>
                             instead of starting with an already esstablish website.<br>
                            
                            I was thinking about what I should make and though it would be a good and fun idea to make a portfolio website.<br>
                            This way I was able to make a fun way to display my skills,<br>
                            while also learning how to put them there effitiently.<br>
                            While looking at insperation of how others had done it I found two that really inspired me in this project.<br>
                                http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/<br>
                                https://www.moritzpetersen.com/<br>
                            They were fun to watch and gave me ideas on what I wanted to do for my website.<br>
