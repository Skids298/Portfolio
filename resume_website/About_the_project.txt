Hello and welcome to my website and the about page, where I will go more indept about the project and the reason behind creating it.
Ofcourse it is not mandetory to read this and you are more than welcome to enjoy the website and the code.

I started this project around august of 2024 as a part of my internship at my college where i did 300 hours of work.
The main idea was to become more profitient in HTML, CSS, and even some JavaScript, 
 while working on something that I had creative freedom over.
It was neccecarry to esstablish a strong foundation before starting on a project for my university.
This way I was able to learn the stuff i needed to know on a black canvas, instead of starting
 with an already esstablish website.

I was thinking about what I should make and though it would be a good and fun idea to make a portfolio website.
This way I was able to make a fun way to display my skills, while also learning how to put them there effitiently.
While looking at insperation of how others had done it I found two that really inspired me in this project.

They were fun to watch and gave me ideas on what I wanted to do for my website.
